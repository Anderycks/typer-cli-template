# Template for Python Typer-based CLI Apps

This is a very simple template for quickly scheming up
Python cli tools using Typer.  To create a repo in the
parent directory of this repo, run the following command:

```bash
./make_repo.sh myapp
```

This will create a directory called "myapp." There are other
files to be edited and updated, but the basic structure is
there to get started building a new cli app.
